# Cura Slow Z

This Plugin is plagiarized from an initial existing Cura Plugin : [Cura-Slow-Z](https://github.com/5axes/Cura-Slow-Z) by [5axes](https://github.com/5axes)

Cura uses the same speed for top and bottom layers infill.
This plugin adds a setting named "Enable Bottom Layers Infill" to the speed settings in the Custom print setup of Cura. It allows for a specific speed for bottom layers infill.

This setting can be found in the Custom print setup by using the Search field on top of the settings. If you want to make the setting permanently visible in the sidebar, right click and select "Keep this setting visible".
